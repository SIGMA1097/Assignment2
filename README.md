Explaination of the Code

•	The LogisticRegression class is used to import the Logistic Regression model from Scikit-Learn.

•	Using the Logistic Regression algorithm, the model is trained and predictions are made using test data.
	
•	The confusion_matrix function from scikit-learn is used to print the confusion matrix.

•	The classification_report function is used to print the classification report. However, the code is not currently being executed because it is commented out. The precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class might be printed by uncommenting the line and adding the target_names option.

•	Performance metrics for both the SVM and Naive Bayes models are shown in the results.
